datamatch (aka Lopper)
======================

==INTRODUCTION
Lopper is tool to prune phylogenetic datasets to a common list of taxa.

A common requirement of comparative phylogenetic analysis tools is 
that the objects to compare contain exactly the same taxa. Often this 
is not the case: for example a phylogenetic tree might contain taxa 
for which data has not been collected, or different studies of a 
family might contain slightly different species.

Lopper allows the user to take two files that contain taxonomic 
information and compare them to each other. The result is two new 
files, in the same format as the input ones, that contain only those 
taxa that are present in both inputs. These files can be a list, a 
phylogenetic tree and a trait data table in any combination.

Optionally, the tool can return the lists of matched and mismatched taxa.

==SOURCE
Source code is available at: https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/datamatch


==DEPENDENCIES
This code requires:

 * R, the statistical computing platform: http://www.r-project.org/


==INSTALLATION
Install R. Run this script in R.


==USAGE
Rscript lopper.R -f FORMATS [OPTIONS] FILE1 FILE2

Reduces a pair of files which contain taxa names (tree, trait matrix, list) to the common set of taxa.

 -h --help                      Prints this help.

 -v --version                   Prints the program's version.

 -f FORMAT --format FORMAT      Format of FILE1 and FILE2. If only one format is provided it is used for both files.
 	Currently supported formats are:
 		csv: table of traits in comma separated value format
 		csvx: table of traits in comma separated value without header format
 		nwk: phylogenetic tree in newick format
 		nex: phylogenetic tree in nexus format
 		lst: list of taxa names in plain text.

 -m NUM --mismatches NUM        Lists of mismatched taxa to save:
	0 = none (default)
	1 = FILE1
	2 = FILE2
	3 = both FILES.

 -a AUTHORITY --auth AUTHORITY  Authority for resolution of taxa name. 
                                Ignored if TNRS is not used.
 	Currently supported authorities
 		"tropicos" (default): Tropicos, botanical information system 
 		at the Missouri Botanical Garden

 -t NUM --tnrs NUM              Use Taxonomic Resolution Service for:
                                0 = none (default)
                                1 = FILE1
                                2 = FILE2
                                3 = both FILES.

 -j --json                      The output is sent as a JSON string 
                                to STDOUT and no files are generated 
                                (options -m and -o are ignored).
